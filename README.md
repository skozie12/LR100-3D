# LR100-3D: Product Configurator

## Overview
LR100-3D is a browser-based 3D simulator for Taymer's line of rope coiling equipment. This interactive visualization allows users to configure and visualize different coiler models, reels, counters, and cutters in a physically accurate 3D environment.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of rope coiling equipment
- **Physics-Based Rope Simulation**: Realistic rope physics powered by Cannon.js
- **Equipment Configuration**: Mix and match different reels, counters, cutters, and coilers
- **Real-time Pricing**: Dynamic price calculations based on selected components
- **High Performance**: Web Worker-based physics calculations for smooth operation
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and scene management
- **Cannon.js**: For physics simulation
- **Node.js**: For running the app
- **Web Workers**: For offloading physics calculations
- **GLTFLoader**: For loading 3D models

### Architecture
The simulator uses a main thread for rendering and user interface, while a separate Web Worker handles physics calculations. This approach ensures smooth performance even with complex rope simulations involving hundreds of segments.

### Rope Physics
The rope is modeled as a series of connected spherical bodies with distance constraints between them. The physics simulation handles:
- Collision detection between rope and coiler
- Realistic coiling behavior based on coiler geometry
- Dynamic segment addition as the rope coils

### Coiler Models
Each coiler model has unique physical properties:
- **LR100-10**: Radius 0.189, supports 400 rope segments
- **LR100-99**: Radius 0.155, supports 400 rope segments
- **LR100-200**: Radius 0.105, supports 300 rope segments

## Usage

1. Select a Reel Stand from the dropdown menu
2. Select a Counter model
3. Select a Coiler model
4. Optionally, select a Cutter (requires a Counter to be selected)
5. Watch the simulation run automatically
6. Observe the current price calculated based on your selections

## Browser Compatibility

This application utilizes modern web technologies and requires:
- WebGL 2.0 support
- Web Workers support
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
